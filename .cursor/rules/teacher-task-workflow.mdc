# Teacher Task Workflow

Follow this workflow for every new task the user gives (from images, text, or context).

## 0) Understand the Task

- Read all provided context (images, text, code, prior edits).
- Extract concrete deliverables and constraints.
- If anything is ambiguous, resolve from context; only ask if truly blocked.

## 1) Create a Dedicated Folder for the Task

- Derive a concise, kebab-case folder name that represents the task.
- Create a parent folder for the task at the workspace root.
- Inside it, create any required subfolders (e.g., `microservice`, `monolith`).
- Keep all generated artifacts scoped under this task folder to avoid clutter.

Example: “create a java microservice and a java monolith for speed comparison” → `java-speed-test/` with subfolders `microservice/` and `monolith/`.

## 2) Create and Maintain a Checklist (tasks with SUBTASKS)

- In the task root, create `tasks.md` with a hierarchical checklist of tasks and subtasks.
- Keep items small and actionable; prefer several subtasks over broad tasks.
- Update `tasks.md` after every step (mark progress, add/adjust subtasks as needed).

Suggested `tasks.md` template:

```md
# Tasks

1. High-level task A
   1.1 Subtask A1
   1.2 Subtask A2
2. High-level task B
   2.1 Subtask B1
   2.2 Subtask B2

## Progress Log

- [yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm] What changed, what’s next
```

## 3) Track Progress Continuously

- After each action or prompt, immediately update `tasks.md` to reflect status.
- Use a brief progress log entry per step with what was done and what’s next.

## 4) Cleanup Before Finishing

- Remove temporary or unused files, scratch notes, and dead code inside the task folder.
- Keep only what a teacher expects to review (sources, configs, README/docs, results).
- Ensure the repository remains tidy (no random artifacts outside the task folder).

## 5) Document the Work

- In the task root, create `documentation.md` describing:
  - The task description (what was requested)
  - Approach and rationale
  - Steps/commands to reproduce
  - Results and verification steps
  - Cleanup performed and any follow-ups

Suggested `documentation.md` outline:

```md
# Documentation

## Task

Briefly restate the assignment.

## Approach

Key decisions and rationale.

## Steps to Reproduce

Commands, configs, and how to run/verify.

## Results

What works, measurements (if any), screenshots/links.

## Cleanup

What was removed and why. Follow-ups if needed.
```

## Operational Notes

- Prefer absolute paths when running tools/commands as appropriate.
- Use non-interactive flags for commands.
- Keep edits minimal and targeted; don’t reformat unrelated code.
- When creating new files for a task, place them under the task’s folder.
